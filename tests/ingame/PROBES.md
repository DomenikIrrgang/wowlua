# In-game probes to run

The probes that would close the emulator's open gaps
([coverage report](../../docs/emulator-coverage.md)), for WoW Forever (the
camelot flavor). Install a current StdTest build first (`wowlua install
--client _classic_beta_` in `tests/ingame`), then `/reload` in game so it
loads.

Everything here is read-only: no item is used, nothing is bought, moved or
sent, the character does not move, and no output stores a player's name.
After a run that StdTest records, `/reload` writes the results to the saved
variables; `cargo xtask ingest` then takes them into the fixtures.

## Still to run (2026-10-21, postponed)

The beta's last day left these open, most needed first. Each gives data the
engine cannot get otherwise.

1. **`/stdtest engine screen` with "Use UI Scale" on and the slider all the
   way left**, then `/reload`. Why: the scale rule with "Use UI Scale" on
   is recorded at 1.15 only (UIParent's scale is the slider's); its lower
   bound is not. That run was blocked last time: note the blocked
   function's name in the message ("StdTest has been blocked from an
   action..."): it is a taint finding (StdTest's code tainting Blizzard's
   settings code), for the engine's taint emulation too.
2. **A fresh Human Warrior's `/stdtest snapshot`**, twice a few seconds
   apart, then `/reload`. Why: the engine's default world is that
   character; the new snapshot also records its mounts, toys and wardrobe
   (decision T235).
3. **The replay scenarios** with a fresh character (step by step in the
   session notes): a quest turned in for an item reward
   (`/stdtest engine scenario turnin`), a second level-up (`levelup`),
   Heroic Strike with a target change (`heroicstrike`), smelting bronze
   (`smelting`, needs Mining); each `/stdtest engine scenario stop` then
   `/reload`. Why: see "Replay leftovers" below.
4. **The SuuUI Escape check** (by hand): see "Regressions" below.
5. **`/stdtest engine journals`** on a character with a mount or a toy.
   Why: the events after a collected mount's or toy's favourite changes are
   unrecorded (the recording character had none; decision T235).
6. **How the client breaks lines**: done 2026-10-24 (the beta's last
   night): `tests/client/forever-camelot-wrap.lua` in wowlua-engine, with a
   `/run` of line counts at widths 6 to 70; the engine follows it (decision
   T282). Left open: why the client keeps some texts on one line below two
   glyphs' width, and one line count without word wrap.
7. **An early landing** (the scenario recorder as for the taxi): at a
   flight master, pick a route with a stop on the way; type
   `/stdtest engine scenario earlylanding`, take the flight, and before the
   first stop `/run TaxiRequestEarlyLanding()`; once landed,
   `/stdtest engine scenario stop` and `/reload`. Why: the engine lands the
   flight a server round trip after the request (decision T289, a guess:
   it keeps no stops on the way); the recording gives when it lands and
   which events come.
8. **Atlases on a 1x screen**: the answers battery's atlas checks at a
   1920x1080 screen with Windows' DPI scale at 100%. Why: both recordings
   were on high-DPI screens and gave the 2x textures' files and
   coordinates (decision T238); a 1x screen may take the 1x textures (the
   sizes are the same either way).
9. **Talents the engine doesn't know yet**: partly done 2026-10-24
   (`tests/client/forever-camelot-talents2.lua` in wowlua-engine: the spec
   groups' configs, the active config, another class's view loadout). Left
   open: a rank planned and taken back (`PurchaseRank` refused, the
   character had no unspent point) and `/stdtest engine talentwatch` (a
   level-up to 5).
10. **Addon messages restricted?** In a raid out of an instance and out of
   combat: `/dump C_ChatInfo.AreOutgoingAddonChatMessagesRestricted(),
   C_ChatInfo.InChatMessagingLockdown()`, then
   `/dump C_ChatInfo.SendAddonMessage("SuuUI", "x", "RAID")` and whether a
   raid member's SuuUI hears it. Why: the full probe recorded `true` for
   the first (alone, out of combat), so the engine answers `true` always;
   SuuUI's raid planner no longer reads it (its specs were never shared).
11. **Moving a raid member**: as leader, `SetRaidSubgroup(i, g)`; then
   `GetRaidRosterInfo(i)` at once and after `GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE` (with
   `GetTime()` at each). Why: SuuUI's probe saw the update 0.4-0.7 s
   later; the engine moves them and fires it at once.

- **`GetBindingText(key, 1)` with modifiers** (the action bars' hotkeys):
  `SHIFT-1`, `CTRL-ALT-2`, `META-E`, `SHIFT-MOUSEWHEELUP`, `SHIFT-NUMPAD1`.
  Why: the engine shortens the modifiers with the client's
  `*_KEY_TEXT_ABBR` strings and joins them with `-` (`s-1`), and keeps the
  key's own name whole; neither the joining nor the key names are
  recorded (M12's default-UI screenshot showed the hotkeys cut to `SHI…`).

## The answers battery's new calls

About a minute, standing anywhere, out of a group and out of combat.

1. Log in (or `/reload` if the game was running) so the new StdTest loads.
2. Type `/stdtest engine answers` and wait for the chat line `engine answers:
   N calls recorded; type /reload so the file is written`. It can pause for a
   few seconds (map lookups, atlases, glyph measurements).
3. Type `/reload`, then run `cargo xtask ingest`.

If the game freezes or crashes instead, the newest file in the client's
`Errors/` folder shows where it stopped (its "Lua Stack").

What it answers:

- Coins: `GetCoinIcon` 0/99/9999, `C_CurrencyInfo.GetCoinIcon` 100/10000.
- Units: `UnitStat("player", 6)`, `GetSpellBonusDamage` 2 to 8,
  `GetMirrorTimerInfo` 2/3/4, `C_PaperDollInfo.GetTemporaryEnchantmentInfo`
  16/17/18/20, `GetNumCompanions("MOUNT")`/`("CRITTER")`, `UnitGUID(nil)`;
  what `UnitName`/`UnitPVPName` give for 17 unit tokens ("none", "target",
  "softenemy"...), as nil, empty, length and whether it equals the player's
  own (no names are stored).
- Game rules: `C_GameRules.IsGameRuleActive` 10/213/214, and every
  `Enum.GameRule` value in one check.
- Commentator and timeline: `C_Commentator.GetTeamColor` 2/3;
  `C_EncounterTimeline.GetCurrentTime()` between two `GetTime()`s.
- Artifact: `C_ArtifactUI.GetCostForPointAtRank` ranks 2 to 10 (both
  argument orders), `GetTotalPowerCost` for a few spans.
- Maps: `C_Map.GetWorldPosFromMapPos` at (0,0) and (1,1) for every recorded
  map; `C_Map.GetMapPosFromWorldPos` for 6 world points (Orgrimmar,
  Crossroads, Mulgore, Stormwind, Ironforge, Undercity) without and with 8
  override maps; `GetMapChildrenInfo` of 1414/1415/947 as counts and IDs;
  which map IDs from 1 to 2500 exist.
- Layout: `C_Texture.GetAtlasInfo` (size, file, texture coordinates, tiling)
  for every atlas the engine knows; string width, height and unbounded width
  of 8 texts and every printable ASCII glyph in GameFontNormal,
  GameFontHighlightSmall, SystemFont_Shadow_Large_Outline and
  NumberFontNormal.
- Script objects: `CreateFrame(..., "BackdropTemplate")`;
  `CreateAbbreviateConfig` with divisors 1/1 (raw and global abbreviation)
  and 60 (as significand and as fraction divisor); writing a field to a
  `C_Timer.NewTimer` and a `NewTicker` handle (both cancelled at once).

## The collections (decision T235)

About a minute, on any character, out of combat; the journals may stay
closed. A character with a mount or a toy also records the events after its
favourite changes; without, the probe records whether the client takes an
uncollected one's (a new character has its starting gear's appearances).

1. Type `/stdtest engine journals` and wait for the chat line `engine
   journals: ... lines; type /reload so the file is written` (about 7
   seconds). It records the order of the mount journal's and the toy box's
   lists (as their filters are, and with every filter on, put back after),
   and every event the client sends when one mount's, one toy's and one
   appearance's favourite changes. Each favourite is changed and put back,
   a second apart; the filters are put back as they were.
2. Type `/stdtest snapshot`: the world profile now records the mount
   journal (every mount with its info, and which uncollected ones the
   character can ride), the toy box (its collected toys; its checks are
   opened for it, put back after) and the wardrobe's collected sources. A toy
   whose item the client has not loaded is asked for: run the snapshot a
   second time a few seconds later so its name comes along.
3. Type `/reload`, and keep a copy of `WTF/Account/<account>/SavedVariables/StdTest.lua`.
4. Then `/stdtest engine journals2` (about 8 seconds, any character): each
   filter's CVar on its own, the toy box's list a second after its filters
   change, every toy, and an appearance's favourite in three more categories,
   on and off. Everything is put back. `/reload` after.

## The method probe

About 10 to 15 minutes, after the answers battery, out of combat, standing
anywhere. `/stdtest engine methodprobe` calls every widget method the client
has (about 13,000 calls on 53 widget kinds), each on a fresh widget under a
hidden frame of its own: nothing shows, no Blizzard frame is touched, no
setting changes. It reloads the UI by itself every 500 calls.

1. Type `/stdtest engine methodprobe`. The chat says `methodprobe: N calls
   (...)`; after each reload it prints `methodprobe: n/N calls answered`. Do
   not type while it runs; in combat it waits. `/stdtest engine methodprobe
   status` shows where it is, `/stdtest engine methodprobe stop` pauses it
   (the same command goes on).
2. It ends with `methodprobe: done, ...; reloading so the file is written`
   and, after that reload, `methodprobe: finished`.
3. Run `cargo xtask ingest` (it writes `forever-camelot-methodprobe.lua`).

If the game freezes or crashes, start it again and log in with the same
character. The probe notices the crash at login, sets that stretch of 500
calls aside, goes on, and comes back to it in smaller steps until the one
call that crashes is found and skipped. The riskiest calls (boundary numbers
like -1 and 2^31-1) come last. More than three crashes: keep the newest file
in `Errors/` and the output of `/stdtest engine methodprobe status`.

## Before and after the next full probe

- `/stdtest engine snapshot` right before `/stdtest engine fullprobe` and
  again right after it finishes, so the replay starts from the exact state
  (bind location, mail, macros, channels, the quest log).
- `/run for i=1,GetNumBindings() do local c=GetBinding(i) print(i,c) end`
  (binding command names only): the binding list.
- `/dump C_Spell.GetSpellPowerCost(20271)`, `/dump C_Spell.GetSpellInfo(20271)`
  and `/dump C_Spell.IsSpellHarmful(20271)` (Judgement): spell cost, range,
  cast time and harmfulness, the data `IsHarmfulAction` needs.
- `/run print(date("%H:%M"), date("!%H:%M"))`: the machine's time zone, for
  `C_DateAndTime.GetCalendarTimeFromEpoch`.

## Situations (one /dump each, whenever it happens)

A screenshot of the output or the values typed back is enough.

1. Under water (until the breath bar shows): `/dump GetMirrorTimerInfo(1)`,
   `/dump GetMirrorTimerInfo(2)` and `/dump GetMirrorTimerProgress("BREATH")`:
   a running breath timer.
2. In a party: `/dump UnitGroupRolesAssigned(), UnitGroupRolesAssigned("player"), UnitGroupRolesAssigned("party1")`
   and `/dump UnitGetAvailableRoles("party1")`: whether the no-argument form
   follows the group role.
3. Inside a dungeon or battleground entrance (only when going there anyway):
   `/dump GetInstanceInfo()` and `/dump GetRealZoneText()`.
4. With a soft target showing:
   `/run local n=UnitName("softinteract") print(n and #n, n==UnitName("target"))`
   (only the length is printed).
5. With a temporary weapon enchant already on (do not use one just for
   this): `/dump C_PaperDollInfo.GetTemporaryEnchantmentInfo(16)` and
   `/dump GetWeaponEnchantInfo()`.
6. In combat with a target that has a buff or debuff:
   `/run local a=C_UnitAuras.GetAuraDataByIndex("target",1) print(a and issecrettable(a), a and issecretvalue(a.spellId), a and issecretvalue(a.duration), a and issecretvalue(a.name))`
   and the same for `C_UnitAuras.GetPlayerAuraBySpellID(<one of your buffs' spell IDs>)`:
   whether the aura table or only its fields are secret.

7. In a party when a member logs out or back in (decision T249): a frame
   registered for `UNIT_CONNECTION` and `GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE` printing each
   with its arguments: whether `UNIT_CONNECTION("party1", false)` comes, for
   `target` too while they're targeted, and before or after the roster
   update.

8. Anywhere, once: an addon's timer on the encounter timeline. That it
   goes on it is settled (2026-10-22: SuuUI's pull countdown shows on its
   timeline in game; the engine keeps script events, decision T255); what
   it answers is the engine's guess from the documentation:
   `/dump C_EncounterTimeline.AddScriptEvent({ spellID = 100, iconFileID = 132337, duration = 30, overrideName = "Probe" })`,
   then `/dump C_EncounterTimeline.GetEventList()` and, for the ID,
   `/dump C_EncounterTimeline.GetEventInfo(<id>)`,
   `/dump C_EncounterTimeline.GetEventState(<id>)`,
   `/dump C_EncounterTimeline.GetEventTimeRemaining(<id>)`: the ID (the
   engine counts from 41), the info's fields (its `spellName` the
   `overrideName`), the state while it runs (0) and after it ran out.

9. In combat, from an addon (a `/run` counts as one): `/run C_Spell.PickupSpell(6603)`
   (Auto Attack) and `/run PickupAction(1)`: whether either is blocked as
   `C_SpellBook.PickupSpellBookItem` is (decision T253), then
   `/run ClearCursor()`.

10. On a rogue (or a druid in cat form), in a fight with a target: a frame
    registered for `UNIT_POWER_UPDATE`, `UNIT_POWER_FREQUENT` and
    `PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED` printing each with its arguments, then build
    two combo points and
    `/dump GetComboPoints("player", "target"), UnitPower("player", Enum.PowerType.ComboPoints), UnitPowerMax("player", Enum.PowerType.ComboPoints)`;
    then target another creature and dump again. Why: the engine has no
    combo points (SuuUI's finding V31): their events, and whether they stay
    on the target or with the player.
11. In a duel with a friend (when one happens anyway): a frame registered
    for `UNIT_FACTION` and `PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED` printing each with its
    arguments, the friend targeted;
    `/dump UnitCanAttack("player", "target"), UnitReaction("target", "player"), UnitIsEnemy("player", "target")`
    before the duel starts, during it, and after. Why: a unit can't turn
    hostile in the engine (SuuUI's finding V30): the events and answers as
    it does.

## Replay leftovers

- Before turning in a quest with an item reward, two lines:
  `/run Q=function() print(GetTime(), C_Container.GetContainerNumFreeSlots(0)) end`
  then `/run local f=CreateFrame("Frame") f:RegisterEvent("QUEST_TURNED_IN") f:SetScript("OnEvent",function() Q() C_Timer.After(0.2,Q) end)`:
  when the reward takes its bag slot.
- Around a second level-up: `/stdtest engine scenario`, to confirm the
  specialization event is batched.
- Queue Heroic Strike on a mob, then change target before the swing; note
  any error text.
- While smelting bronze with copper, tin and bronze stacks all in the bags
  (with and without a skill-up), and once crafting with the last reagent
  stack: `/stdtest engine scenario`. Answers the order of the item counts
  and when a used-up stack is removed (the profession replay's leftovers).

## The guild

One `/dump` each, any time (names in the output can be cropped from a
screenshot).

1. `/dump C_GuildInfo.GuildControlGetRankFlags(2), C_GuildInfo.GuildControlGetRankFlags(3)`
   and the same for 4 and 5.
2. `/dump GuildControlGetAllowedShifts(3), GuildControlGetAllowedShifts(4), GuildControlGetAllowedShifts(5)`
3. `/run for i=1,GetNumGuildMembers() do local _,r,ri,l,c=GetGuildRosterInfo(i) print(i,ri,l,c) end`
   (rank index, level and class only), once with "show offline" on and once
   off.
4. `/run for i=3,10 do print(GetGuildTradeSkillInfo(i)) end`
5. `/dump C_Club.GetClubInfo(C_Club.GetGuildClubId())` and
   `/dump C_Club.GetClubPrivileges(C_Club.GetGuildClubId())`.

## Widget state (decision T289)

The engine's guesses for methods that had no behaviour. Anywhere, out of
combat; each step is one line to paste, then a screenshot of the chat.

**Frame levels** (`Raise`, `Lower`):

1. `/run A=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,UIParent) B=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,UIParent) A:SetFrameStrata("FULLSCREEN_DIALOG") B:SetFrameStrata("FULLSCREEN_DIALOG") B:SetFrameLevel(7) A:Raise() print(A:GetFrameLevel(),B:GetFrameLevel())`
2. `/run C=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,UIParent) C:SetFrameStrata("FULLSCREEN_DIALOG") C:SetFrameLevel(20) C:Hide() A:Raise() print(A:GetFrameLevel())`
3. `/run A:Lower() print(A:GetFrameLevel(),B:GetFrameLevel())`

Screenshot after step 3. The engine says 8 7, then 8 (a hidden frame
doesn't count), then 0 7.

**An edit box's selection** (`HighlightText`, `Insert`):

4. `/run E=CreateFrame("EditBox",nil,UIParent) E:SetSize(200,20) E:SetPoint("CENTER") E:SetFontObject(ChatFontNormal) E:SetAutoFocus(false) E:SetText("hello world") E:HighlightText(0,5) E:Insert("HELLO") print(E:GetText(),E:GetCursorPosition())`
5. `/run E:SetScript("OnTextChanged",function(s,u) print("changed",u) end) E:Insert("!") print("after Insert")`
6. `/run E:SetCursorPosition(1) E:SetText("abc") print(E:GetCursorPosition())`
7. `/run E:SetText("abcdef") E:HighlightText(4,1) E:Insert("Z") print(E:GetText())`

Screenshot after step 7. The engine says `HELLO world 5`; then "after
Insert" before "changed false" (Insert's `OnTextChanged` comes in the next
frame, as SetText's); then 3; then `aZef` (a selection given backwards is
the same one).

8. `/run E:SetScript("OnEditFocusGained",function(s) s:HighlightText() end) E:SetText("Sheep")`
9. By hand: click into the box (in the middle of the screen), type `x`.
10. `/run print(E:GetText()) E:ClearFocus() E:Hide()`

Screenshot after step 10. The engine says `x`: the text selected on focus
stays selected after the click, and typing replaces it. If the click put
the cursor somewhere instead, it says where the text went.

**A font copied** (`CopyFontObject`):

11. `/run F1=CreateFont("ProbeF1") F1:SetFont("Fonts\\FRIZQT__.TTF",14,"OUTLINE") F1:SetTextColor(1,0,0) F2=CreateFont("ProbeF2") F2:CopyFontObject(F1) F1:SetTextColor(0,1,0) print(F2:GetFont()) print(F2:GetTextColor())`

Screenshot. The engine says the file, 14 and OUTLINE, then 1 0 0 1: a
copy, not a link to the other font.

**Anchors moved** (`AdjustPointsOffset`, `ClearPointsOffset`):

12. `/run P=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,UIParent) P:SetPoint("TOPLEFT",10,20) P:AdjustPointsOffset(5,-5) print(select(4,P:GetPoint(1))) P:ClearPointsOffset() print(select(4,P:GetPoint(1)))`

Screenshot. The engine says 15 15, then 0 0. If the client keeps the
adjustment apart from the point, `GetPoint` may say 10 20 both times.

**The clears**:

13. `/run Q=CreateFrame("Button",nil,UIParent) Q:SetNormalTexture("Interface\\Buttons\\WHITE8X8") T=Q:GetNormalTexture() Q:ClearNormalTexture() print(Q:GetNormalTexture(),T:IsShown(),T:GetParent()==Q)`
14. `/run M=CreateFrame("PlayerModel",nil,UIParent) M:SetModel(130737) M:ClearModel() print(M:GetModelFileID())`

Screenshot after step 14. The engine says nil false true, then 0.

**At a vendor** (the merchant's window open):

15. `/run local f=CreateFrame("Frame") f:RegisterEvent("MERCHANT_UPDATE") f:SetScript("OnEvent",function(_,e) print(e,GetMerchantFilter(),GetMerchantNumItems()) end) print(LE_LOOT_FILTER_ALL,LE_LOOT_FILTER_CLASS,GetMerchantFilter(),GetMerchantNumItems())`
16. `/run SetMerchantFilter(LE_LOOT_FILTER_ALL)`
17. `/run ResetSetMerchantFilter()`

Screenshot after step 17. The engine keeps the filter and tells
`MERCHANT_UPDATE` once per change, every item still listed; the client may
list fewer items with the class filter.

**In a guild**:

18. `/run print(GetGuildRosterSelection()) SetGuildRosterSelection(2) print(GetGuildRosterSelection()) SetGuildRosterSelection(999) print(GetGuildRosterSelection())`

Screenshot. The engine says 0, 2, 0 (a row past the roster selects
none).

## Targeting and history (decision T291)

**Tab-targeting**, near a few creatures (out of combat):

1. `/run local f=CreateFrame("Frame") f:RegisterEvent("PLAYER_TARGET_CHANGED") f:SetScript("OnEvent",function() print(UnitName("target"),UnitReaction("target","player")) end)`
2. Press Tab five times, then Shift-Tab twice.

Screenshot. The engine cycles the hostile and neutral creatures within
40 yards nearest first, Shift-Tab back; the names and reactions show
whether neutral ones count and how far it looks.

**An edit box's history and arrows**:

3. `/run H=CreateFrame("EditBox",nil,UIParent) H:SetSize(200,20) H:SetPoint("CENTER") H:SetFontObject(ChatFontNormal) H:SetAutoFocus(false) H:AddHistoryLine("one") H:AddHistoryLine("two") print(H:GetHistoryLines())`
4. `/run H:SetScript("OnArrowPressed",function(s,k) print("arrow",k,s:GetText()) end) H:SetScript("OnTextChanged",function(s,u) print("changed",u,s:GetText()) end) H:SetFocus()`
5. By hand: press Up twice, then Down twice.
6. `/run H:SetHistoryLines(5) H:AddHistoryLine("three") H:SetFocus()`
7. By hand: press Up, then Escape.

Screenshot after step 7. The engine keeps no line without
`SetHistoryLines` (step 5 changes nothing), runs `OnArrowPressed` before
the text changes, and step 7 brings back "three".

## Leftovers (decision T295)

**Money on the cursor** (bags open, some money):

1. `/run local f=CreateFrame("Frame") f:RegisterEvent("CURSOR_CHANGED") f:SetScript("OnEvent",function(_,e,...) print(e,...) end) PickupPlayerMoney(1) print(GetCursorMoney(),GetCursorInfo())`
2. `/run ClearCursor() print(GetCursorMoney())`

Screenshot after step 2. The engine says `CURSOR_CHANGED false 2 0 0`,
then 1 (and no cursor info), then `CURSOR_CHANGED true 0 2 0` and 0.

**Assignments** (as a raid leader, a member targeted):

3. `/run local f=CreateFrame("Frame") f:RegisterEvent("GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE") f:SetScript("OnEvent",function(_,e) print(e) end) SetPartyAssignment("MAINTANK","target") C_Timer.After(1,function() print(GetPartyAssignment("MAINTANK","target")) end)`

Screenshot. The engine tells `GROUP_ROSTER_UPDATE` at once and true.

**A system line and Sign**:

4. `/run SendSystemMessage("probe line") print(Sign(-3),Sign(0),Sign(2))`

Screenshot. The engine shows "probe line" as a system message, then
-1 0 1.

## Regressions and other flavors

1. With SuuUI's current bags, open the spellbook, enter combat (a training
   dummy is enough) and press Escape: the spells window should close, with no
   "Interface action failed" in chat. Confirms the fix the regression test
   `suuui_bag_calls_taint_escape_in_combat` stands for.
2. On a classic flavor's client (vanilla, tbc, wrath or mists), run the
   function inventory probe as on camelot, so the engine knows which of the
   old global names (`GetItemCount`, `InviteUnit`, `UseContainerItem`, ...)
   that client really defines.

## Model frames' cameras

The wardrobe's head shots (`Model_ApplyUICamera`) sit off center in
wowlua's screenshots: how the client's model frame camera sees a model is
not known yet. Answered (2026-10-23, decision T334) with a DressUpModel of
the player under UIParent and UI camera 542 at 200 by 250 and 400 by 250,
with and without `SetPosition(0, 0, 0)`; the wardrobe's head cells match
a Skyborne female's screenshot once the camera follows the race (T335).
Still open: the body's transmog skin (`useTransmogSkin`, drawn dark in
game, the character's clothes in wowlua).

1. Open the appearances collection on the head slot and take a screenshot of
   the first page (the cells' framing to compare with).
2. With the collections open, two lines:
   `/run M=WardrobeCollectionFrame.ItemsCollectionFrame.Models[1] print(M:GetCameraPosition()) print(M:GetCameraTarget()) print(M:GetPosition())`
   then `/run print(M:GetFacing(), M:GetPitch(), M:GetRoll()) print(M:IsUsingModelCenterToTransform()) print(M:TransformCameraSpaceToModelSpace(CreateVector3D(4,0,0)):GetXYZ())`
3. `/run local m=CreateFrame("PlayerModel") m:SetSize(100,100) m:SetUnit("player") print(m:GetCameraDistance(), m:GetCameraPosition()) print(m:GetCameraTarget())`
   Answers the model frame's own camera and field of view.

## Textures the screenshots draw

1. `/run local t=MainStatusTrackingBarContainer.bars and MainStatusTrackingBarContainer.bars[1] or nil print(t and t.StatusBar:GetStatusBarTexture():GetAtlas(), t and t.StatusBar:GetStatusBarTexture():GetTexture())`
   with the experience bar shown: whether `SetStatusBarTexture(atlasName)`
   makes the texture's atlas (wowlua: it does; `GetTexture` answers the
   atlas's file ID, decision T356).
2. An action button with a spell: `/run local b=ActionButton1 print(b.icon:GetDrawLayer()) print(b.SlotArt:GetDrawLayer()) print(b.icon:GetNumMaskTextures())`
   and a screenshot of it hovered: wowlua draws a masked texture over the
   unmasked ones of its layer and sublevel (the icon over the slot art).
   Answered (2026-10-23): both `BACKGROUND` 0, one mask, as in wowlua;
   still open: the hovered screenshot (which of the two is drawn on top).
3. `/run local t=UIParent:CreateTexture() print(t:IsSnappingToPixelGrid(), t:GetTexelSnappingBias())`:
   a fresh texture's pixel snapping (wowlua: true, 0). Answered
   (2026-10-23): true, 0.30000001192093; wowlua now gives the same.
4. What `GetTexture` answers for an addon's own file, an atlas and a color
   (decision T356; wowlua: the file's negative loose ID, the atlas's file
   ID, nil), and what `GetTextureFilePath` answers (wowlua: the path set).
   With an addon that ships a texture (here SuuUI's
   `Interface\AddOns\SuuUI\media\logo`; use any file it has):
   1. `/run T=UIParent:CreateTexture() print(T:SetTexture("Interface\\AddOns\\SuuUI\\media\\logo"), T:GetTexture(), T:GetTextureFileID(), T:GetTextureFilePath())`
   2. `/run print(GetFileIDFromPath("Interface\\AddOns\\SuuUI\\media\\logo"))`
   3. `/run T:SetAtlas("128-RedButton-Exit") print(T:GetTexture(), T:GetTextureFileID(), T:GetTextureFilePath())`
   4. `/run T:SetColorTexture(1, 0, 0) print(T:GetTexture(), T:GetTextureFileID(), T:GetTextureFilePath())`
   5. `/run print(GetFileIDFromPath("Interface\\AddOns\\NoSuchAddon\\x"), GetFileIDFromPath("Interface\\Buttons\\WHITE8X8"))`
      (wowlua: nil, 130871; decision T355).

## Minimap

wowlua draws the minimap's terrain at the long-known zoom spans and the
player's arrow 32 by 32 UI units; neither is recorded on camelot.

1. Outdoors in Northshire (or any place with a landmark near), take a
   screenshot of the minimap at each zoom: `/run Minimap:SetZoom(0)` to
   `/run Minimap:SetZoom(5)`, with `/run print(UnitPosition("player"))`
   and `/run print(C_Map.GetPlayerMapPosition(C_Map.GetBestMapForUnit("player"), "player"):GetXY())`
   for each. The landmark's distance in the shots gives each zoom's span.
2. The same spot with `/console rotateMinimap 1`, facing east: the terrain
   turned and the arrow up.
3. In a party, a screenshot of the minimap with a member in sight, and
   one of a ping (click the minimap) at once, with
   `/run C_Timer.NewTicker(0.5,function() print("ping",GetTime(),Minimap:GetPingPosition()) end,16)`
   first: the blip's size, the ping's look and how long it keeps its
   place (`RegisterEvent("MINIMAP_PING")` is refused as unknown,
   2026-10-23: a callback event alone).
4. Which callback events `RegisterEvent` refuses, and whether an addon's
   callback hears one:
   `/run P=function(e) local f=CreateFrame("Frame") print(e,(pcall(f.RegisterEvent,f,e)),C_EventUtils.IsEventValid(e)) end`
   then `P` for each of the documentation's twelve `CallbackEvent`s, and
   `/run CreateFrame("Frame"):RegisterEventCallback("MINIMAP_PING",function(_,...) print("cb",...) end)`
   before a ping (the payload's order).

## Unanchored textures and slider thumbs

1. `/run local f=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,UIParent) f:SetSize(200,100) f:SetPoint("CENTER") local t=f:CreateTexture() t:SetSize(40,20) print(t:GetNumPoints(), t:GetSize())`
   then the same with a texture from XML that has `<Size>` and no
   `<Anchors>` (any addon's): wowlua fills the parent with an XML one
   (2 points, the parent's size), leaves a Lua one unplaced.
2. Open Settings, Mouse, hover the Mouse Look Speed slider with
   `/fstack` on, and note the thumb's left relative to the slider at the
   value shown, at the minimum and at the maximum (wowlua: it travels the
   slider's width less the thumb's, by the value). Answered for a
   horizontal slider made in Lua (2026-10-23): it does, by one point,
   `LEFT` to the slider's `LEFT`; still open: a vertical slider's point.


## Owed from the M12 screenshots (next beta, about 2026-11-07)

The camelot beta closed on 2026-10-24; these close what the screenshot work
left as proposals. Each item stands alone: after a `/reload` (or an error)
start the item again from its first step. In the chat box `|` is escaped,
so the lines write it as `\124`. Take the screenshots with the default UI
alone unless an item names an addon.

1. **Load-on-demand addons' reason** (decision T354; wowlua:
   `DEMAND_LOADED` before loading, empty after). With AtlasLoot installed:
   1. `/run for i=1,C_AddOns.GetNumAddOns() do local n,_,_,l,r=C_AddOns.GetAddOnInfo(i) if C_AddOns.IsAddOnLoadOnDemand(i) then print(n,tostring(l),"["..tostring(r).."]",C_AddOns.IsAddOnLoaded(i)) end end`
   2. `/run print(C_AddOns.LoadAddOn("AtlasLootClassic_Crafting"), "["..tostring(select(5,C_AddOns.GetAddOnInfo("AtlasLootClassic_Crafting"))).."]")`
2. **AceGUI's `SetDesaturation`** (AtlasLoot's options window: wowlua has
   no such global, so AceGUI's checkbox errors):
   1. `/run print(SetDesaturation, LibStub and LibStub("AceGUI-3.0",true) and select(2,LibStub("AceGUI-3.0")))`
3. **Which point sets an edge** (decision T337; wowlua: `TOPLEFT` places
   the left edge over `LEFT`, whatever order they were set in, so `50 50`;
   `GetPoint(1)` stays the first set, `RIGHT`):
   1. `/run F=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,UIParent) F:SetHeight(10) F:SetPoint("RIGHT",UIParent,"CENTER") F:SetPoint("LEFT",UIParent,"CENTER",-100,0) F:SetPoint("TOPLEFT",UIParent,"CENTER",-50,0)`
   2. `/run print(UIParent:GetWidth()/2-F:GetLeft(), F:GetWidth(), (F:GetPoint(1)))`
4. **A button's font objects by name** (decision T338; wowlua: a name
   works, an unknown name unverified):
   1. `/run local b=CreateFrame("Button",nil,UIParent) b:SetNormalFontObject("GameFontRed") print(b:GetNormalFontObject():GetName()) print(pcall(b.SetHighlightFontObject,b,"NoSuchFont"))`
5. **Font strings over textures in one layer** (decision T340; wowlua: the
   text is drawn over the red, though made first):
   1. `/run F=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,UIParent) F:SetSize(240,60) F:SetPoint("CENTER") local s=F:CreateFontString(nil,"ARTWORK","GameFontNormalHuge") s:SetPoint("CENTER") s:SetText("TEXT ON TOP?")`
   2. `/run local t=F:CreateTexture(nil,"ARTWORK") t:SetAllPoints() t:SetColorTexture(1,0,0)`
   3. A screenshot.
6. **A frame on its parent's level** (decision T341; wowlua: the child's
   green `BACKGROUND` is drawn under the parent's blue `ARTWORK`, the two
   sorted together by layer):
   1. `/run local p=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,UIParent) p:SetSize(200,100) p:SetPoint("CENTER") local a=p:CreateTexture(nil,"ARTWORK") a:SetPoint("LEFT") a:SetSize(120,100) a:SetColorTexture(0,0,1) P=p`
   2. `/run local c=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,P) c:SetUsingParentLevel(true) c:SetAllPoints() local g=c:CreateTexture(nil,"BACKGROUND") g:SetPoint("RIGHT") g:SetSize(120,100) g:SetColorTexture(0,1,0)`
   3. A screenshot: is the middle strip blue (wowlua) or green?
7. **`SetFrameLevel` and descendants** (decision T343; wowlua: the
   child raised by 5 moves with the parent, the grandchild stays one over
   its parent):
   1. `/run P=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,UIParent) C=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,P) C:SetFrameLevel(P:GetFrameLevel()+5) G=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,C) print(P:GetFrameLevel(),C:GetFrameLevel(),G:GetFrameLevel())`
   2. `/run P:SetFrameLevel(P:GetFrameLevel()+10) print(P:GetFrameLevel(),C:GetFrameLevel(),G:GetFrameLevel())`
8. **Inline textures in text** (decision T347; wowlua: the icon is as tall
   as the text for height 0, the atlas 20 by 20, each its width in the
   line):
   1. `/run S=UIParent:CreateFontString(nil,"OVERLAY","GameFontNormal") S:SetPoint("CENTER") S:SetText("ab") print(S:GetStringWidth(),S:GetStringHeight())`
   2. `/run S:SetText("a\124TInterface\\Icons\\INV_Misc_QuestionMark:0\124tb\124A:128-RedButton-Exit:20:20\124ac") print(S:GetStringWidth(),S:GetStringHeight())`
   3. A screenshot of the text in the middle of the screen.
9. **The dressing room** (decision T348; wowlua: `OnDressModel` once per
   changed slot, at once; the outfit list shows an item it does not know
   as not collectable, red):
   1. `/run DressUpItemLink("item:2575") DressUpFrame.ModelScene:HookScript("OnDressModel",function(_,...) print("dress",GetTime(),...) end)`
   2. `/run DressUpItemLink("item:6125")`
   3. A screenshot of the dressing room with the outfit list open.
10. **Gradients** (decision T349; wowlua: red at the left to blue at the
    right, and turned with the texture):
    1. `/run local t=UIParent:CreateTexture() t:SetSize(200,50) t:SetPoint("CENTER") t:SetColorTexture(1,1,1) t:SetGradient("HORIZONTAL",CreateColor(1,0,0,1),CreateColor(0,0,1,1)) T=t`
    2. A screenshot.
    3. `/run T:SetRotation(math.pi/4)` and a screenshot.
11. **`.png` and `.jpg` paths of `.blp` files** (decision T350; wowlua: a
    `.tga` or `.png` the storage lacks is its `.blp`, a `.jpg` unverified):
    1. `/run local t=UIParent:CreateTexture() for _,x in ipairs({".blp",".tga",".png",".jpg",""}) do print(x,t:SetTexture("Interface\\FriendsFrame\\StatusIcon-Online"..x),t:GetTexture()) end`
12. **Text in a scaled frame** (decision T351; wowlua: 0.8 the size, the
    width the same in the frame's units):
    1. `/run F=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,UIParent) F:SetScale(0.8) F:SetSize(200,40) F:SetPoint("CENTER") S=F:CreateFontString(nil,"OVERLAY","GameFontNormal") S:SetPoint("CENTER") S:SetText("Scaled 0.8 text")`
    2. `/run print(S:GetStringWidth(),S:GetEffectiveScale())`
    3. A screenshot.
13. **A creature display's portrait** (decision T353; wowlua: the face,
    framed as a unit's portrait):
    1. `/run local t=UIParent:CreateTexture() t:SetSize(128,128) t:SetPoint("CENTER") SetPortraitTextureFromCreatureDisplayID(t,7970)`
    2. A screenshot (7970 is Taragaman the Hungerer, AtlasLoot's).
14. **An unknown atlas** (decision T346; wowlua: `SetAtlas` leaves the
    texture as it was; its answer unknown):
    1. `/run local t=UIParent:CreateTexture() t:SetColorTexture(1,0,0) print(t:SetAtlas("NoSuchAtlas"), t:GetAtlas(), t:GetTexture())`
15. **Restricted callback events** (decision T336; wowlua: refused from
    addon code, `ADDON_ACTION_FORBIDDEN` with `Frame:RegisterEventCallback()`).
    It shows a blocked-action message: `/reload` after it.
    1. `/run local f=CreateFrame("Frame") print(f:RegisterEventCallback("COMBAT_LOG_ENTRIES_CLEARED",print))`
16. **Tooltip spacing** (decision T342; wowlua: 10 padding, 2 between
    lines, 40 between a double line's sides):
    1. `/run GameTooltip:SetOwner(UIParent,"ANCHOR_NONE") GameTooltip:SetPoint("CENTER") GameTooltip:AddLine("Title") GameTooltip:AddDoubleLine("Left","Right")`
    2. `/run GameTooltip:AddLine("A long line to see where and how a tooltip wraps its text",1,1,1,true) GameTooltip:Show() print(GameTooltip:GetSize())`
    3. A screenshot of the tooltip.
17. **PvP ranks 5 to 14** (decision T345; wowlua's formula gives 24150 for
    14, the table 24750):
    1. `/run for n=5,14 do print(n,C_MajorFactions.GetTotalReputationForRenownLevel(2800,n)) end`
    2. `/run for n=2,6 do local r=C_MajorFactions.GetRenownRewardsForLevel(2800,n) print(n,#r,r[1] and (r[1].name or r[1].itemID)) end`
18. **The calendar's holidays** (open: wowlua shows no holiday events):
    1. Open the calendar on this month and take a screenshot.
    2. `/run local m=C_Calendar.GetMonthInfo(0) for d=1,m.numDays do for j=1,C_Calendar.GetNumDayEvents(0,d) do local e=C_Calendar.GetDayEvent(0,d,j) print(d,e.title,e.calendarType,e.sequenceType,e.eventID) end end`
19. **The skill bars' fill.** In game (screenshot of 2026-10-23, build
    70532, the same Blizzard code as wowlua's) the skills list's bars fill
    the whole track at any value, the left `p` of the atlas stretched over
    it (`SetTexCoord(0, p, 1, 0)`), while the detail pane's bar fills by
    value (87/150 to 57%). wowlua fills the list's by value too. Blizzard's
    `SetFillPercent` sets the fill to `p * FillArea:GetWidth()`, so in game
    `FillArea` must read 0 when the rows are set, and a 0-wide fill with one
    point is drawn at its atlas size (240, clipped by the bar's mask). Why
    it reads 0 is open: rows made and initialized in the same frame are the
    likely cause, but Blizzard's micro menu and text-to-speech options read
    sizes of regions made moments before at login and need them at once
    (unless they fail silently in game; step 1 shows it). Steps:
    1. `/console scriptErrors 1`, then `/reload`; note any error shown at
       login (`FrameUtil.lua:247`, `TextToSpeechFrame.lua:597`?), then
       `/console scriptErrors 0`.
    2. `/reload`, and do not open the character window before step 4.
    3. `/run hooksecurefunc(SkillsBarMixin,"SetFillPercent",function(b,p) local a=b.FillArea print(format("%.2f",p),a:GetWidth(),tostring(a:IsRectValid()),b:GetWidth(),b:GetParent():GetParent():GetWidth()) end)`
    4. Open the character window's Skills tab; note the lines printed.
    5. `/run for _,f in ipairs(SkillsFrame.ScrollBox:GetFrames()) do local s=f.Content and f.Content.SkillsBar if s then print(s.FillArea:GetWidth(),s.Fill:GetWidth(),s.Fill:GetTexCoord()) end end`
    6. `/run local b=SkillsFrame.SkillDetailFrame.RankBar print(b.FillArea:GetWidth(),b.Fill:GetWidth())`
    7. `/run T=UIParent:CreateTexture(nil,"OVERLAY") T:SetAtlas("common-stat-bar-blue",true) T:SetPoint("LEFT",UIParent,"CENTER",-100,0) T:SetWidth(0) print(T:GetSize())`
    8. A screenshot: is a 240-wide blue bar drawn in the middle (wowlua:
       nothing)?
    9. `/run local p=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,UIParent) p:SetPoint("CENTER") p:SetSize(100,50) local c=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,p) c:SetAllPoints() local g=CreateFrame("Frame",nil,c) g:SetAllPoints() print(g:GetWidth(),g:IsRectValid(),c:IsRectValid())`
       (wowlua: `100 true true`): whether a chain made in one call has its
       size at once.
20a. **Chat the player sends** (decision T360; wowlua: `CHAT_MSG_SAY`
    back, `CHAT_MSG_WHISPER_INFORM` then `CHAT_MSG_WHISPER` for a whisper to
    yourself, `ERR_CHAT_PLAYER_NOT_FOUND_S` for a name nobody has, `ERR_NOT_IN_GROUP`
    for /p alone):
    1. `/run F=CreateFrame("Frame") for _,e in ipairs({"CHAT_MSG_SAY","CHAT_MSG_WHISPER","CHAT_MSG_WHISPER_INFORM","CHAT_MSG_SYSTEM","CHAT_MSG_PARTY"}) do F:RegisterEvent(e) end F:SetScript("OnEvent",function(_,e,...) print(e,...) end)`
    2. `/s probe one`, then `/p probe two` (not in a group).
    3. `/w <your first and last name> probe three`, then `/w Nobody Anyone probe four`.
    4. A screenshot of the chat with the printed lines.
20b. **Typed commands' answers** (decision T362; wowlua's lines in the
    decision). With the frame of 20a also registering `CHAT_MSG_TEXT_EMOTE`,
    `TIME_PLAYED_MSG`, `WHO_LIST_UPDATE`, `PLAYER_FLAGS_CHANGED`, and
    `IGNORELIST_UPDATE`, type each and note what prints:
    1. `/roll`, `/roll 1 6`, `/played`, `/afk`, `/afk`, `/dnd`, `/dnd busy`
    2. `/ignore Nobody Anyone`, `/invite Nobody Anyone`, `/ginvite Nobody Anyone`,
       `/gpromote Nobody Anyone`, `/gquit` (as guild master), `/who Nobody`
    3. `/dance`, `/friend Nobody Anyone`, `/1 hello`, `/join Trade`
20c. **Inviting players** (decision T363), with a second character of yours
    online: `/invite` it and note the lines and how long until it shows in
    the party after accepting; `/promote` and `/kick` it; `/who` with three
    or fewer results and with more (the chat lines); `/ginvite` (the lines
    after it accepts).
20d. **Mouse scripts turn the mouse on** (decision T365; wowlua: `false
    true true true true true`; the in-game suite's "Mouse script enables"
    asks the same):
    1. `/run local f=CreateFrame("Frame") local a=f:IsMouseEnabled() f:SetScript("OnMouseUp",function() end) local b=f:IsMouseEnabled() f:SetScript("OnMouseUp",nil) print(a,b,f:IsMouseEnabled())`
    2. `/run local g=CreateFrame("Frame") g:SetScript("OnEnter",function() end) local h=CreateFrame("Frame") h:SetScript("OnMouseWheel",function() end) print(g:IsMouseEnabled(),h:IsMouseEnabled(),h:IsMouseWheelEnabled())`
    3. Open the character frame (C) and type `/run local t=CharacterFrameModeTab2 print(t:IsMouseEnabled(),t:IsMouseClickEnabled(),t:IsMouseMotionEnabled())`
20. **Screenshots to compare with wowlua's** (in `~/Desktop/wowlua-*`):
    1. Settings, Accessibility: the "Colors" category and the "Use UI
       Scale" check box (Graphics).
    2. The Forever Dungeon Journal: a boss with its portrait (the ring under
       it).
    3. EllesmereUI: the action bars' key labels and the chat window's text.
    4. AtlasLoot: Ragefire Chasm, Taragaman, its loot list.


## Answered on the beta's last day (2026-10-24)

- PvP ranks (major faction 2800): `GetMajorFactionProgressionInfo` gives
  maxLevel 14, renownLevel 0, renownLevelThreshold 750, the weekly fields
  0 and weekNumber -1 on a rank 0 character; ranks 1 to 4 total 750, 1650,
  2700, 3900; rank 1's reward is the Faction Tabard (decision T345).
- A frame anchored to UIParent has its width and left at once and on the
  next frame alike (200, 100).
- A frame anchored inside a frame that is sized but not placed reports
  width 0 (the parent 200): `child 0 200` (decision T346).
- A texture with `SetAtlas(atlas, true)`, a `LEFT` point and `SetWidth(0)`
  reports width 0 and its atlas's height.
- The macro window shows no "Create Macros" title in game either.
- `|cAARRGGBB`'s alpha could not be checked from the chat box (it escapes
  `|`); decision T342 stays a proposal.
- Still owed: the skill bars' fill (item 19 of "Owed from the M12
  screenshots").
