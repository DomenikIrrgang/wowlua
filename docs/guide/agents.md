# AI agents

An agent that can only read your code has to guess what your addon looks like
and does. `wowlua mcp` gives it the emulated WoW client you test and debug
in: it can start your addon, look at the screen, click and type, fire events,
set breakpoints and profile, then check its own fix, with no game client.

## Connect your agent

`wowlua mcp` is a Model Context Protocol server on stdio. It works on the
package it is started in, so register it for your addon's folder, the one
with `wowlua.json`. With Claude Code, run this in that folder:

```console
$ claude mcp add wowlua -- wowlua mcp
```

Any other MCP client runs the same command. In a client configured with JSON,
the server entry looks like this:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "wowlua": { "command": "wowlua", "args": ["mcp"] }
  }
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The agent works on the same emulated client as `wowlua test` and the
> [VS Code debugger](vscode.md#debug-in-the-emulated-client). With your WoW
> installation at hand, its screenshots are drawn with the game's own
> textures and fonts, read on your machine and never copied anywhere.

## What a session looks like

Ask for an outcome, not for tool calls. Say a label in your options window is
cut off, and you ask the agent to fix it and show you the result. A session
goes like this:

1. **Start the addon** The agent starts your addon, logged in, in the flavor
   and world profile you work with. `start_session`
2. **Open the window** It runs the slash command that opens it.
   `slash`
3. **Look** It takes a screenshot of the window and reads the frame tree,
   which gives each frame's size and text. `screenshot`
4. **Fix the code** It changes the anchor or width of the label in your
   source. Then it starts a new session and opens the window again.
   `start_session`
5. **Check** A second screenshot shows the label in full, and the agent
   writes a screenshot test so it stays that way. `screenshot`

## What the agent can do

The tools follow how you work on an addon yourself. Each tool that runs code
answers once the game stops or settles, with where it stopped and what was
printed in the meantime.

### Run

`start_session` starts the addon, logged in, or one of your test files, with
an optional flavor, world profile, clock, and breakpoints to start with.
`stop_session` ends it.

### See

`screenshot` draws the screen or one frame and returns it as an image.
`frame_tree` lists frames with their type, name, shown and visible state,
rectangle and text, and `find_frames` finds frames by name, type or text.

### Act

`click` clicks a frame or a point of the screenshot, as the player would.
`hover`, `drag`, `type_text`, `press_key` and `slash` do the rest of what a
player does, and `fire_event` fires a documented game event. `world` changes
the running world with the controls tests use, such as
`mock.player:setMoney(500)` or `mock.player:enterCombat()`.

### Move time

`advance` moves the game's time on by seconds or frames, so timers,
`OnUpdate` and animations run exactly as far as the agent asks.

### Debug

`set_breakpoints` and `set_function_breakpoints` set line breakpoints and
breakpoints on functions, API calls, events, scripts and timers. `continue`,
`step` and `pause` control the run, `stack` and `variables` show where it
stopped, and `eval` runs Lua in the game or in the stopped function.

### Measure and read

`profile_start` and `profile_stop` profile the session, optionally writing a
speedscope file. `output` returns what the session printed and the errors it
raised.

## Why its results repeat

An agent's sessions run on a manual clock unless it asks for real time: game
time moves only when it calls `advance`, and it stands still while the
session is paused. The same steps give the same screen every time, so a
screenshot before and after a change is a fair comparison, and a bug the
agent found can become a test that fails the same way.

Profiles count Lua instructions as well as time. Instruction counts are the
same on every machine, so a claim such as "this change made `onBagUpdate`
40% cheaper" is one you can check.

## Things worth asking for

| Ask | What the agent does |
|-----|---------------------|
| "Open the options window and fix anything that overlaps." | Opens it with `slash` or `click`, takes a screenshot, finds the frames, edits the code, takes another screenshot |
| "Why does the counter stop after the first loot?" | Sets a breakpoint on the event, fires it with `fire_event`, steps and reads the variables |
| "Invite two party members and check the party frames." | Starts with a world profile that has other players, runs `/invite`, takes a screenshot |
| "Make the bag scan cheaper." | Profiles while it fires bag events, changes the code, compares the instruction counts |
| "Turn what you just checked into a test." | Writes a `@test` with `mock.slash`, `mock.click` and `toMatchScreenshot` |

## Keep what the agent checked

A session proves the fix once, and a test keeps it fixed. The tools map onto
`wowlua:mock`, so the agent can write down what it did as a test:

```wowlua
import test, expect from "wowlua:test"
import * as mock from "wowlua:mock"

@test("the options window fits its labels")
local function labelsFit()
    mock.slash("/myaddon")
    expect(_G.MyAddonOptions).toMatchScreenshot("open")
end
```

[Testing your addon](testing.md) covers screenshots, world profiles and
running tests in CI, and [Debugging](debugging.md) the same debugger in your
editor. The tools and their arguments are in
[Debugger §18.12.2](../../spec/toolchain/debugger.md#18122-wowlua-mcp-model-context-protocol).
