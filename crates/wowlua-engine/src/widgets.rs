//! Widgets (spec emulator §17.6): frames, textures and font strings as the
//! client makes them. A widget is a Lua table holding its object (a
//! userdata) at `[0]`, whose metatable's `__index` is its class's method
//! table: the documented methods of the class and its bases, as natives.
//! A method runs its behaviour here, stores what a setter without one was
//! given (its getter returns it), does nothing if it returns nothing, or
//! fails as not mocked.
//!
//! As `/stdtest engine` recorded on WoW Forever 1.60.1 (fixture
//! `tests/client/forever-camelot-engine.lua`, checked by `wowlua-cli`'s
//! `tests/engine_probe.rs`): events reach frames in registration order;
//! `OnShow` / `OnHide` run children first; `SetScript` clears the hooks;
//! each class has its own method functions; methods check `self` and their
//! documented arguments first (counting `self` as #1, usage `self:Name(…)`,
//! `number` a C float); the client's error messages, with a "Lua Taint:"
//! line where it adds one; `Is…` getters are false until set (a button
//! takes the mouse); alpha keeps eight bits. A template only Blizzard's UI
//! code defines warns while that code is not loaded; any other unknown
//! name fails (decided 2026-10-16). Unverified: `OnSizeChanged` runs with
//! the next frame.
